# MiracleGamesWin32SDK
Seamless Microsoft Store Integration for Win32 Apps &amp; Games - Streamline publishing and full-lifecycle management
## Overview
 * Miracle Games SDK (abbreviation: MG SDK) starts its lifespan after the release of Microsoft 10 system. With the mission of serving developers, the SDK fully uses various types of supports and services provided by Microsoft, and combines the self-developed login system, community system, advertising, sharing and other functions to provide a solid foundation for developers to log in to the Microsoft ecosystem. 
 * MG SDK is developed based on UWP, reserved C++, C#, JS and other languages of the functional interface, so that developers can use the MG SDK in a variety of development environments. For applications developed on different engines and different terminals, we provide developers with corresponding solution to have Android, iOS, H5, Web, Win 32 and other applications quickly ported Win 10 UWP version, and provide them with free technical support services. 
 * With years of Windows 10 UWP application development technology precipitation and experience accumulation, various functions in MG SDK have become efficient and stable. In the docking process, the whole process of exclusively docking MG SDK has been summarized, which makes it more convenient for cooperative developers to use the MG SDK in applications or games, and easily publish it to the Microsoft Store. 
 * MG has brought together a large number of technical experts to create a UWP developer community, providing free technical support services and technical training for UWP developers, so that more developers can join the Microsoft ecosystem and contribute to the construction of the Microsoft ecosystem.
